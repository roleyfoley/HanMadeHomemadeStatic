blurb: >-
    Born and partially breed here in Canberra, I'm passionate about the Nation's Capital and its people. 
    I've had the privilege to interact with a diverse range of businesses, communities and organisations, that have opened my eyes and heart to all the possibilities that we have at our fingertips in this corner of the world. Over the years, working in industries such as hospitality, childcare, education, fitness and health, I've realised how important a balanced and wholesome diet can contribute to the functionality of team,  business or family.
    A passionate mover and groover, I've danced, baked and flowed my way through life to this point and are delighted that these things continue to be the roots of who I am. With the encouragement and support of treasured loved ones, I strive to offer my greatest assistance to helping the community discover their most energised and empowered selves.
