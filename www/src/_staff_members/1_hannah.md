    I'm passionate about the Nation's Capital and its people.
    Having lived here most of my life, I've had the privilege to interact with a diverse range of businesses, communities and organisations. This has opened my eyes and heart to all the possibilities that we have at our fingertips in this corner of the world. Over the years, working in industries such as hospitality, childcare, education, fitness and health, I've realised how important a balanced and wholesome diet can be to the success of teams, businesses or families.
    A passionate mover and groover, I've danced, baked and flowed my way through life to this point and are delighted that these things continue to be the roots of who I am. With the encouragement and support of treasured loved ones, I strive in helping people to find their energised and empowered selves.
