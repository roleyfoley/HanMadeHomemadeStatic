title: Our Story
hero: Our story
idea: 
  Sprouted from a passion for providing wholesome muesli to friends and family, Hanmade Homemade aims to provide the community with sustainable, nutritious and scrumptious ways to fuel your morning.
  I strongly believe that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, whether you have 2 minutes or 10 minutes, Hanmade Homemade will help you find the perfect option that keeps you sharp and spritely throughout the day. 
  All ingredients in Hanmade Homemade products are sourced from local Canberra businesses and with limited plastic packaging and transportation costs, to provide customers with environmentally conscious muesli and snacks while also educating the community on how to reduce food, plastic and material. With each bite, you're supporting the local economy, the environment and your taste bubs.
